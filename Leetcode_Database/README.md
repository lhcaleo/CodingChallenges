## 627. Swap Salary
<a id="markdown-swap-salary" name="swap-salary"></a>

https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-salary/

### Description
<a id="markdown-description" name="description"></a>

Given a table `salary`, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temp table.

Note that you must write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any select statement for this problem.

 

**Example:**

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```

After running your **update** statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:

```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```



### Solution
<a id="markdown-solution" name="solution"></a>

```mysql
UPDATE salary
SET sex = 
    CASE sex
        WHEN 'm' THEN 'f'
        ELSE 'm'
    END
;
# or 
UPDATE salary
SET sex = 
    CASE
        WHEN sex ='m' THEN 'f'
        ELSE 'm'
    END
;
```

**Or, use IF( ) function**

`IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`

```
UPDATE salary
SET sex = IF (sex = 'm', 'f', 'm')
;
```



## 620. Not Boring Movies
<a id="markdown-not-boring-movies" name="not-boring-movies"></a>

https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/

### Description
<a id="markdown-description" name="description"></a>

X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.

Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

For example, table `cinema`:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

For the example above, the output should be:

```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

### Solution
<a id="markdown-solution" name="solution"></a>

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM cinema
WHERE NOT id % 2 = 0 AND NOT description = 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC
;

# or use mod function
# WHERE NOT mod(id,2) = 0 AND NOT description = 'boring'
```

<a id="markdown-solution" name="solution"></a>

```mysql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id
;
```



```mysql
-- More efficient way
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE Id NOT IN -- delete rows that is not in the selection
(   
    SELECT Id FROM
   (
       SELECT MIN(Id) AS Id -- ignore rows with greater Id and same Email
       FROM Person
       GROUP BY Email
   ) AS temp    -- use as temp table, to avoid error
)
;
```

## 178. Rank Scores
<a id="markdown-rank-scores" name="rank-scores"></a>

https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/

### Description
<a id="markdown-description" name="description"></a>

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

### Solution
<a id="markdown-solution" name="solution"></a>

```mysql
-- To determine the ranking of a score, count the number of distinct scores that are >= to that score
SELECT
    S1.Score 'Score',
    ( 
        SELECT 
            COUNT(DISTINCT Score) 
         FROM Scores S2 
         WHERE S2.Score >= S1.Score
    ) AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores S1
ORDER BY Score DESC
;
```



```mysql
-- To determine the ranking of a score, count the number of distinct scores that are >= to that score
SELECT
    S1.Score 'Score',
    COUNT(DISTINCT S2.Score) AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores S1
     INNER JOIN Scores S2
     ON S2.Score >= S1.Score
GROUP BY
    S1.Id, S1.Score
ORDER BY 
    S1.Score DESC
;
```

## 626. Exchange Seats
<a id="markdown-exchange-seats" name="exchange-seats"></a>

https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/

### Description
<a id="markdown-description" name="description"></a>

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column **id** is continuous increment.

 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

 

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

For the sample input, the output is:

 

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

**Note:**
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

### Solution

**Use Multiple Union**

```mysql
# Even id: id - 1
# eg 2,4,6,... to 1,3,5,...
SELECT
    s1.id - 1 AS id,
    s1.student
FROM
    seat s1
WHERE
    MOD(s1.id, 2) = 0 
    
UNION

# Odd idï¼Œid + 1. if the largest id is odd, then ignore
# eg 1,3,5,... to 2,4,6,...
SELECT
    s2.id + 1 AS id,
    s2.student
FROM
    seat s2
WHERE
    MOD(s2.id, 2) = 1
    AND s2.id != ( SELECT max( s3.id ) FROM seat s3 ) 
    
UNION

# If largest id is odd, take this out
SELECT
    s4.id AS id,
    s4.student
FROM
    seat s4
WHERE
    MOD(s4.id, 2) = 1
    AND s4.id = ( SELECT max( s5.id ) FROM seat s5 )
ORDER BY id
;
```
